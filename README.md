# PasswordGeneratorHomework

For this homework assignment I was tasked with creating the JavaScript to generate a random password. The user would be able to select the password length and whether it would contain lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numerals, and/or special characters. It would then generate a password meeting these conditions. If the user did not specify any of the four character options, they would be given an error message.
